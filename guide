// 1. Install Geth: First, make sure you have Geth installed on your system. You can download it from the official Geth repository: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum

// 2. Run the Goerli node: Open a terminal and execute the following command:
geth --goerli --syncmode "fast"
// 3. Wait for synchronization
geth attach
eth.syncing
// If it returns false, the node is fully synchronized and ready for use.

// That's it! You now have a Goerli testnet node running using Geth. You can interact with the node by using the Geth console or by connecting to it via RPC/API endpoints for development purposes.
